The Git bash shell is like any other linux/unix shell, so 
$ pwd prints the working directory, 
$ cd ~ changes to the home directory, 
$ ls -la lists all files including hidden ones, etc. 
$ clear clears the screen
$ [up arrow] shows previous command

Setting up
$ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"

Initialize an empty repo in the current directory
$ git init

Add all directory changes to the project staging area
(working file>>staging area>>repo)
$ git add .

Add a single file to the project staging area
$ git add aSingleFile.txt

Commit the changes from staging area to repo
$ git commit -m "message here"

Add changed files to staging area and commit them
$ git commit -am "message here" (don't use this if changes include new, deleted, or moved files)

Compare repo and working directory
$ git status

View commit history
$ git log
$ git log --oneline 

See differences between unstaged files in the working directory and repo
$ git diff

To see changes between current file and most recently committed one:
$ git diff HEAD -- <filename.txt>

See differences between staged files and repo
$ git diff --staged

Delete a file
$ git rm aFileName 
$ git commit
(rm removes file in working directory and puts the change in staging area ... must still commit)

Rename or move a file (within working directory)
$ git mv oldFileName newFileNameOrPath
$ git commit
(mv moves/renames file in working directory and puts the change in staging area ... must still commit)

HELP! I tried something, it didn't work. I just want to go back
where it was:

I changed test.txt. I saved it, but it has not yet been added (staged) or committed:
$ git checkout test.txt

I changed test.txt, saved it, and committed it: 
$ git commit -m "This is a commit I want to get rid of"
Now I want to "undo" my last commit, in a way that the original commit and the "undoing" commit are visible in history:
$ git revert HEAD

I want to go back to the way things were after commit abc123:
$ git reset --hard abc123
$ git reset --soft HEAD@{1}
$ git commit -m "back to good point with new commit"
[Result:
git log --oneline
bb77 back to good point with new commit
2c7f bad commit
abc1 way things were
So, if necessary you can still reset back to the screwed up stuff. Remember, 
$ git log --all let's you see everything that's been done]

Works with Magic Time Machine, too:
$ git reflog
# you will see a list of every thing you've done in git, across all branches!
# each one has an index HEAD@{index}
# find the one before you broke everything
$ git reset --hard HEAD@{index}
$ git reset --soft HEAD@{1}
$ git commit -m "I just reset to previous commit"

Another option, if you wanted to go back to commit abc123 and not worry about detaching HEADS:
$git checkout -b test-branch abc123  //creates and checks out a new branch, starting with commit abc123
...look at commit abc123, do stuff with it, whatever ... when you want to get rid of it:
$git checkout master
$git branch -d test-branch //deletes new branch

OR you can also revert a file changed in working directory (and not yet committed) to version from last commit, ie, undo changes. Note: working directory will change; directory needs to be staged and committed:
$ git checkout -- aChangedFileName.txt 
[or $ git checkout HEAD -- aChangedFileName.txt //same thing]

Remove what was done during a particular commit:
$ git revert <SHA of commit you want to discard>
$ git commit -am "After revert"

Unstage a file
(file is still changed, still in working directory, just not staged for commit)
$ git reset HEAD aFileName

Reset all files to previous commit
$ git reset --hard abcd
will move everything back to the condition it was at commit abcd, more or less erasing the intervening commits. This only works for rolling back to commits on the same branch.


After creating a GitHub repository, to push an existing repository
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/acolburn/notes.git
$ git push -u origin master
(first line makes "origin" short version for URL we're pushing to, a repo called "notes")
(seconed line pushes everything)

Clone existing GitHub repository
[cd to desired location]
$ git clone https://github.com/acolburn/notes.git Notes
where Notes is a folder to hold files

============================================
TYPICAL WORKFLOW

$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "initial commit" <create repo, stage files, initial commit>
----------
$ git commit -am "message" <commit changes>
----------
$ git tag v1.0 -m "optional message" <tag version>
----------
$ git branch <see list of branches>
----------
$ git branch new-branch
$ git checkout new-branch <make branch (copy), switch to it ... now commit, etc.>
----------
$ git checkout master <switch back to master>
----------
$ git merge new-branch <merge new-branch to master>
(optional: $ git branch -d new-branch ... deletes new-branch)
